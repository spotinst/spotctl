Package `yacspin` provides yet another CLi spinner for Go, taking inspiration
(and some utility code) from the https://github.com/briandowns/spinner project.
Specifically `yacspin` borrows the default character sets, and color mappings to
github.com/fatih/color colors, from that project.

## License
Because this package adopts the spinner character sets from https://github.com/briandowns/spinner,
this package is released under the Apache 2.0 License.

## Yet Another CLi Spinner?
The other Go spinner ties the ability to show updated information to the
spinner's animation, meaning you can't always show all the information you want
to the end user without changing the animation speed. In addition there were
also some API design choices that have made it unsafe for concurrent use (while
it's running), which presents challenges when trying to update the text in the
spinner while it's animating in the first place

There was also an interest in the spinner being able to represent a task, and to
indicate whether it failed or was successful. This would have further compounded
the API issues mentioned above.

This project takes inspiration from that other project, and takes a new approach
to address the challenges above.

## Features
#### Provided Spinners
There are over 30 spinners available in the `CharSets` package variable. They
were borrowed from [github.com/briandowns/spinner](https://github.com/briandowns/spinner).
There is a table with all of the spinners [at the bottom of this README](#Spinners).

#### Dynamic Width of Animation
Because of how some spinners are animated, they may have different widths are
different times in the animation. The spinner calculates the maximum width, and
pads the animation to ensure the text's position on the screen doesn't change.
This results in a smoother looking animation.

#### Success and Failure Results
The spinner has both a `Stop()` and `StopFail()` method, which allows the
spinner to result in a success message or a failure message. The messages,
colors, and even the character used to denote success or failure are
customizable in either the initial config or via the methods.

By doing this you can use the spinner to display the satus of a list of tasks
being executed serially.

##### Stop

##### StopFail

#### Concurrency
The spinner is safe for concurrent use, so you can update any of its settings
via methods whether the spinner is stopped or is currently running.

#### Live Updates
Most spinners tie the ability to show new messages with the animation of the
spinner. So if the spinner animates every 200ms, you can only show updated
information every 200ms. If you wanted more frequent updates, you'd need to
tradeoff the asthetics of the animation to display more data.

This spinner updates the printed information of the spinner immediately on
change, without the animation updating. This allows you to use an animation
speed that looks astheticaly pleasing, while also knowing the data presented to
the user will be updated live.

You can see this in action in the following gif, where the filenames being
uploaded are rendered independent of the spinner being animated:

#### Pausing for Updates
Sometimes you want to change a few settings, and don't want the spinner to
render your partially applied configuration. If your spinner is running, and you
want to change a few configuration items via method calls, you can `Pause()` the
spinner first. After making the changes you can call `Unpause()`, and it will
continue rendering like normal with the newly applied configuration.

## Usage
```
go get github.com/theckman/yacspin
```

Within the `yacspin` package there are some default spinners stored in the
`yacspin.CharSets` variable, and you can also provide your own. There is also a
list of known colors in the `yacspin.ValidColors` variable.

```Go
cfg := yacspin.Config{
	Frequency:       100 * time.Millisecond,
	CharSet:         yacspin.CharSets[59],
	Suffix:          " backing up database to S3",
	SuffixAutoColon: true,
	Message:         "exporting data",
	StopCharacter:   "âœ“",
	StopColors:      []string{"fgGreen"},
}

spinner, err := yacspin.New(cfg)
// handle the error

spinner.Start()

// doing some work
time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)

spinner.Message("uploading data")

// upload...
time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)

spinner.Stop()
```
