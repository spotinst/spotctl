/*
	Package box is largely copied from Vic Sh√≥stak's (aka Koddr) work at https://github.com/koddr/example-embed-static-files-go/
    and documented by him at (dev.to)[https://dev.to/koddr/the-easiest-way-to-embed-static-files-into-a-binary-file-in-your-golang-app-no-external-dependencies-43pc

    It's used here to package sets of kubernetes manifests so they can be read internally and posted to a
    kubernetes cluster
